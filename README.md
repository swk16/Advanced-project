# Advanced-project
###  link 
### Project time
I'll break down my development process into three time periods
#### The direction period
As I proposed at the beginning of the advanced project, I wanted to create a tool to create 3D model format objects through artificial intelligence and machine learning that could be used in unity, unreal and other game engines, but after talking to Charisma.ai, I realized that I didn't have a lot of artificial intelligence and couldn't do it on my own. I am not able to develop this tool independently.
After talking to my supervisor Phoenix and visiting the interactive design studio in Liverpool, it became clear to me that my speciality is human-computer interaction and interactive projects.
#### Inspiration and learning period
I am one of those people who, when completing any of my projects, wants to tap into a part of culture, be it mythology, history, etc., as I did when I chose the 7 Deadly Sins as inspiration for my first semester pcomp coursework.
I was attracted to The Religious System of China: Its Ancient Forms, Evolution, History and Present Aspect by J.J.M. de Groot, which introduces Chinese religion from a Western perspective, and found that Taoist feng shui was becoming widely.So starting with the history of Taoism and choosing the element of Bagua as the main element for the creation.
#### Practice period
After experiencing the last demonstration where some of the group used leap motion for gesture manipulation interaction, this fascinated me and there is probably not a boy who would not be blown away by the spaced out manipulation display in the Iron Man movie. So I chose to use vr glasses with gesture interaction to develop the game experience I wanted in unity.
