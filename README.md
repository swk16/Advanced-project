Taoist Eight Trigrams(bagua) is an interactive experience presented as a virtual reality (VR) artwork: the traditional Chinese cultural Taoist Bagua. A system of yin and yang representing the changes of things themselves, symbolising various natural phenomena that are combined in parallel according to the yin and yang changes of nature to form eight different forms. The system is based on the unity game engine and combines oculus meta quest 2 with leap motion gesture control. Through this game scenario we extract the eight elements of the eight trigrams corresponding to heaven, earth, wind, thunder, water, fire, mountain and lake.

The core purpose of this piece is to explore the spiritual core of Taoism in Chinese culture, the Eight Trigrams and Yin Yang, the Five Elements, and to present them to participants in a gamified way. This piece is based on the eight trigrams and the properties of the elements they represent, creating different game scenarios. It emphasises the concept that things are profoundly interconnected, corresponding to the Taoist concept that all things are related to each other and that Yin and Yang harmonise to produce balance.

### Project time
I'll break down my development process into three time periods
#### The direction period
As I proposed at the beginning of the advanced project, I wanted to create a tool to create 3D model format objects through artificial intelligence and machine learning that could be used in unity, unreal and other game engines, but after talking to Charisma.ai, I realized that I didn't have a lot of artificial intelligence and couldn't do it on my own. I am not able to develop this tool independently.
After talking to my supervisor Phoenix and visiting the interactive design studio in Liverpool, it became clear to me that my speciality is human-computer interaction and interactive projects.
#### Inspiration and learning period
I am one of those people who, when completing any of my projects, wants to tap into a part of culture, be it mythology, history, etc., as I did when I chose the 7 Deadly Sins as inspiration for my first semester pcomp coursework.
I was attracted to The Religious System of China: Its Ancient Forms, Evolution, History and Present Aspect by J.J.M. de Groot, which introduces Chinese religion from a Western perspective, and found that Taoist feng shui was becoming widely.So starting with the history of Taoism and choosing the element of Bagua as the main element for the creation.
#### Practice period
After experiencing the last demonstration where some of the group used leap motion for gesture manipulation interaction, this fascinated me and there is probably not a boy who would not be blown away by the spaced out manipulation display in the Iron Man movie. So I chose to use vr glasses with gesture interaction to develop the game experience I wanted in unity.
During the development process I discovered a modified dreamfield3D content generator based on dreamfield-torch, and I also tried to change the input and train it to generate 3-dimensional files in .ply and .obj format to be placed in the game scenes, which fulfilled my initial vision.
